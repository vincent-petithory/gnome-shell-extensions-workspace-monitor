A panel to view live-previews of a selected workspace's windows.

Features:
 * Displays all the windows of a selected workspace.
 * Go to the window, on click.
 * Option in extension's preferences to adjust the maximum size of the panel.
 * Option in extension's preferences to select the display mode:
    ** Overlay mode: the panel will overlay above other windows of the active workspace,
    ** Dock mode: the panel will reserve space (as the gnome shell's top bar does).

Use cases:
 * You want to have visible windows at all times, but you dont have a dual monitor. This is for you.
 * (in a future version) You want a window list that actually displays the real window, not only an icon and/or a title.
