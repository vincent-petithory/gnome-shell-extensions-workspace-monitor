* Add a preference to anchor the panel on the left or right
* Intellihide in overlay mode
* Compact layout + keep the panel at always the same size
* Fix bug: a workspace monitor with a "desktop window" stays displayed below 
  the genuine workspace monitor which displays the correct list of windows 
  when the user "inserts" a workspace under certain circumstances (but unable to reproduce it)
