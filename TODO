- Add a preference to anchor the panel on the left or right
* Intellihide in overlay mode
* Display button to close the app
* Reverse window mode: show all windows that arent in the actual workspace when using the track active workspace feature
* Fix bug: a workspace monitor with a "desktop window" stays displayed below 
  the "real" workspace monitor which displays the correct list of windows 
  when the user "inserts" a workspace under certain circumstances (but unable to reproduce it)
